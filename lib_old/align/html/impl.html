If you use the Alignment API and/or the Alignment server and are
willing to be included here (this certainly help supporting this work), do not
hesitate to contact us.

<p style="font-size: 80%">
This list is obviously incomplete. Most of the systems have at least a
published reference. They are not necessarily independent from our work.

<h2>Systems embedding the Alignment API</h2>

<p>These systems can use any implementation of the API and thus take
  advantage of all matching system extending the API.

Title: Towards a Scalable and Collaborative Information Integration Platform and Methodology

Abstract: The quality and scalability problems in information integration are still not sufficiently solved by current integration approaches. In this paper, we propose an integration approach that adopts a uniform, context-aware, and collaborative methodology enabling efficient reuse to come to a scalable integration platform. We present a two-step methodology that splits up the traditional process of information integration into two separated phases. In the first phase, the Mapping phase, heterogeneous models are matched and mappings are created between the corresponding entities. We further introduce a community and contextual dimension for each mapping. In the second phase, the Commitment phase, a final, application-specific alignment is created in a certain integration format. We argue that this methodology enables a more scalable. efficient and collaborative integration process. We have developed a platform which is based on this methodology and have also done a preliminary evaluation by going through a real use case.

Title: QoS-Aware Semantic Service Selection: An Optimization Problem
Source: IEEE CONGRESS ON SERVICES 2008, PT I, PROCEEDINGS: 384-388 2008
Conference Title: IEEE Congress on Services
Conference Date: JUL 06-11, 2008
Conference Location: Honolulu, HI
Abstract: In order to select the best suited service among a set of discovered services, with respect to QOS parameters, a user have to state his or her preferences, so services can be ranked according to these QOS parameters. Current Semantic Web Services ontologies do not support the definition of QOS-aware user preferences, though there are some proposals that extend those ontologies to allow selection based on those preferences. However, their selection algorithms are very coupled with user preferences descriptions, which are defined without semantics or at a different semantic level than service functionality. In this work, we present a service selection framework that transforms user preferences into an optimization problem where the best service is selected. This framework is based on an ontology that conceptualizes these user preferences. Thus, we use a very expressive solution decoupled with the concrete selection technique by using XSL transformations, while describing QOS-aware user preferences at the same semantic level of functional preferences.

Title: SmartMatcher - How examples and a dedicated mapping language can improve the quality of automatic matching approaches

Abstract: Information integration has a long history in computer science. It has started with the integration of database schemas in the early eighties. With the rise of the semantic web and the emerging abundance of ontologies, the need for an automated integration increased further A lot of automated matching approaches and tools have been proposed so far The typical output of such tools is a simple one-to-one alignment mostly, based on schema information, e.g., similar names and structures of schema elements. However these alignments cannot cope with schema heterogeneities, hence, the,,e problems must be resolved manually. Furthermore, then? is no automated evaluation of the quality of the alignments-based on the instance level, because the matching approaches are not bound to a specific integration scenario, e.g., transformation or merge. In this work, we propose the SmartMatching approach, which can be seen as an orthogonal extension to existing matching approaches for increasing the quality of the automatically produced alignments for the transformation scenario. This is achieved by using an executable mapping language for bridging schema heterogeneities and by using instance models to evaluate the quality of the alignments in an iterative and feedback-driven process inspired by machine learning approaches.

Abstract: We combine the Semantic Web with the Web, as background knowledge, to provide a more balanced solution for Ontology Mapping. The Semantic Web can provide mappings that are missed by the Web, which can provide many more, but noisy, mappings. We present a combined technique that is based on variations of existing approaches. Our experimental results in two real-life thesauri are compared with previous work, and they reveal that a combined approach to Ontology Mapping can provide more balanced results in terms of precision, recall and confidence measure of mappings. We also discover that a reduced set of 3 appropriate Hearst patterns can eliminate noise in the list of discovered mappings, and thus techniques based exclusively in the Web can be improved. Finally, we also identify open questions derived from building a combined approach.

Title: Text-based domain ontology building using Tf-Idf and metric clusters techniques
Source: KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW, 22 (4): 379-403 DEC 2007
Abstract: The paper describes the methodology used to develop a construction domain ontology, taking into account the wealth of existing semantic resources in the sector ranging from dictionaries to thesauri. Given the characteristics and settings of the construction industry, a modular, architecture-centric approach was adopted to structure and develop the ontology. The paper argues that taxonomies provide an ideal backbone for any ontology project. Therefore, a construction industry standard taxonomy was used to provide the seeds of the ontology, enriched and expanded with additional concepts extracted from large discipline-oriented document bases using information retrieval (IR) techniques.

Abstract: One of the challenges of the Semantic Web is to integrate the huge amount of information already available on the standard Web, usually stored in relational databases. In this paper, we propose a formalization of a logic model of relational databases, and a transformation of that model into OWL, a Semantic Web language. This transformation is implemented in Cross, as an open-source prototype. We prove a relation between the notion of legal database state and the consistency of the corresponding OWL knowledge base. We then show how that transformation can prove useful to enhance databases, and integrate them in the Semantic Web.

Abstract: Some of the most outstanding problems in Computer Science (e.g. access to heterogeneous information sources, use of different e-commerce standards, ontology translation, etc.) are often approached through the identification of ontology mappings. A manual mapping generation slows down, or even makes unfeasible, the solution of particular cases of the aforementioned problems via ontology mappings. Some algorithms and formal models for partial tasks of automatic generation of mappings have been proposed. However, an integrated system to solve this problem is still missing. In this paper, we present AMON, a platform for automatic ontology mapping generation. First of all, we show the general structure. Then, we describe the current version of the system, including the ontology in which it is based, the similarity measures that it uses, the access to external sources, etc.

Title: Comparing two approaches for aligning representations of anatomy
Source: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE, 39 (3): 227-236 MAR 2007
Conference Title: 1st International Workshop on Formal Biomedical Knowledge Representation (KR-MED 2004)
Conference Date: JUN 01, 2004
Conference Location: Whistler, CANADA
Abstract: Objective: To analyze the comparison, through their results, of two distinct approaches applied to aligning two representations of anatomy.
Materials: Both approaches use a combination of lexical and structural techniques. In addition, the first approach takes advantage of domain knowledge, while the second approach treats alignment as a special case of schema matching. The same versions of FMA and GALEN were aligned by each approach. Two thousand one hundred and ninety-nine concept matches were obtained by both approaches.
Methods and results: For matches identified by one approach only (337 and 336, respectively), we analyzed the reasons that caused the other approach to fail.
Conclusions: The first approach could be improved by addressing partial lexical matches and identifying matches based solely on structural similarity. The second approach may be improved by taking into account synonyms in FMA and identifying semantic mismatches. However, only 33% of the possible one-to-one matches among anatomical concepts were identified by the two approaches together. New directions need to be explored in order to handle more complex matches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper gives a never completely account of approaches that have been used for the research community for representing knowledge. After underlining the importance of a layered approach and the use of standards, it starts with early efforts used for artificial intelligence researchers. Then recent approaches, aimed mainly at the semantic web, are described. Coding examples from the literature are presented in both sections. Finally, the semantic web ontology creation process, as we envision it, is introduced. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
